The dataset, sourced from automobile_data.csv, comprises 205 entries across 26 features, encompassing a diverse range of car attributes from technical specifications like engine size and horsepower to descriptive details such as make, body style, and fuel type.\n","\n","Initial data understanding revealed a mixed bag of data types, with several crucial columns like 'normalized-losses', 'num-of-doors', 'bore', 'stroke', 'horsepower', 'peak-rpm', and 'price' being erroneously identified as object types due to the presence of '?' placeholders for missing or unknown values. This necessitated a significant data wrangling step, converting these columns to numeric types and handling the resulting NaN values appropriately to ensure accurate analysis. No duplicate entries were found, indicating a clean record set in terms of unique vehicle identification.\n","\n","The EDA yielded several critical insights into the automotive market represented by this dataset. In terms of market presence, Toyota emerged as the most dominant manufacturer, closely followed by Nissan and Mazda, suggesting a strong consumer preference or market availability for these brands. Conversely, several brands held only a minimal representation, highlighting niche markets or limited data capture. Fuel type analysis underscored the overwhelming prevalence of gasoline-powered vehicles, with diesel cars forming a distinct minority.\n","\n","Pricing dynamics were a central focus. A clear positive correlation was observed between car price and performance-related attributes such as 'engine-size', 'horsepower', 'curb-weight', 'length', and 'width'. This indicates that larger, more powerful, and substantial vehicles generally command higher prices. Conversely, a notable inverse relationship was identified between 'city-mpg' (and likely 'highway-mpg') and 'price', implying that more fuel-efficient cars tend to be more affordable, while luxury or high-performance vehicles often sacrifice fuel economy for power, leading to higher price tags. The overall distribution of car prices was right-skewed, with most vehicles falling into the low to mid-price range, and a few high-end outliers representing premium segments.\n","\n","Further segmentation insights revealed the 'body-style' and 'drive-wheels' as significant differentiators. Sedans were by far the most popular body style, followed by hatchbacks and wagons, reflecting a preference for practical vehicle types. Convertibles and hardtops were less common. Examining 'drive-wheels' showed that rear-wheel drive (RWD) vehicles generally occupied higher price brackets, often associated with performance or luxury, while front-wheel drive (FWD) vehicles were typically more budget-friendly. Four-wheel drive (4WD) cars presented a moderate price range, with some high-priced outliers. The 'num-of-doors' distribution highlighted a clear dominance of four-door cars, followed by two-door models, aligning with general consumer demand for family-oriented vehicles.\n","\n","These insights provide a robust foundation for strategic business decisions. For product development, the focus could be on popular segments like gasoline sedans from top manufacturers while strategically developing performance RWD models. Pricing strategies can be refined by leveraging the strong correlation between engine characteristics and price, ensuring competitive positioning within each segment. Marketing efforts can be tailored to target specific customer demographics for fuel-efficient vs. performance vehicles. However, businesses must also be mindful of potential negative growth scenarios, such as missing out on emerging trends (e.g., EVs, different body styles), market saturation risks in popular segments, or inventory challenges if high-priced, low-demand vehicles are overstocked. The comprehensive understanding gained from this EDA empowers more informed decisions across various business functions.\n","\n","The final task is to review and refine the generated project summary for clarity, conciseness, and adherence to the specified word count and content requirements.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"QhjUb5yY8mBu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Write Problem Statement Here.**"],"metadata":{"id":"DpeJGUA3kjGy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### **Define Your Business Objective?**"],"metadata":{"id":"PH-0ReGfmX4f"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"id":"eVfHe5xwUdGv"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Answer Here."],"metadata":{"id":"PhDvGCAqmjP1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **General Guidelines** : -  "],"metadata":{"id":"mDgbUHAGgjLW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
